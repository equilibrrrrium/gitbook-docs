# Strategies

Congratulations! You've made it this far. Now that you're ready to start using EquiliBRRRRium to earn some great yields, let's look at some basic strategies you can follow as a framework for your own investment strategy. We'll break things down by complexity and relative risk, so feel free to mix and match elements according to your own level of experience, investment goals, and risk tolerance..

The strategies described here are intended only to illustrate how to use the Bomb Money protocol and **do not constitute financial advice**. Always do your own research and make your own decisions with regard to how you use EquiliBRRRRium.

**Semi-active Restaking Strategy**

Once you have familiarized yourself with EquiliBRRRRium and how everything works, you might be interested to try an active and advanced strategy to diversify your passive income streams and potentially increase yields.&#x20;

One way to do this would be to buy some BRRRR and pair it with BNB to receive BRRRR-BNB LP tokens. (Refer to the Provide LP section for instructions on how to do this.) You can then stake those LP tokens in our Farms to earn BRRRRSHARE, which you can then withdraw on a regular basis and stake in the Boardroom to earn additional BRRRR when above peg and the Boardroom is printing. What you do with the BRRRR you earn then is up to you.

### **More Complex/Active Strategies**

As the EquiliBRRRRium ecosystem grows, more complex, advanced, and active strategies will emerge. Once you fully understand the protocol and how all its mechanisms interact, feel free to experiment. Keep in mind these fundamental aspects of the protocol when you are thinking about how to most optimally balance your portfolio:&#x20;

1- The Boardroom only prints for BRRRRSHARE stakers when the peg is above 1.01.

2- The higher BRRR is above peg, the more BRRRR is printed for BRRRRSHARE stakers in the Boardroom. This makes staking BRRRRSHARE more attractive the higher above peg we currently are.

3- Conversely, BRRRRSHARE becomes less attractive as BRRRR dips below peg.&#x20;

Ultimately, the goal of an advanced user of the protocol should be **to help maintain the peg**.

Doing so will result in the greatest rewards for not only yourself as an individual, but for every person participating in the protocol as a whole.&#x20;

Strategically rebalancing your portfolio to apply buying pressure to BRRRR when below peg, or selling pressure when above peg, can be a very profitable strategy, but is not without risk. As such, this type of strategy is for experienced users only. Youâ€™ve been warned!.
