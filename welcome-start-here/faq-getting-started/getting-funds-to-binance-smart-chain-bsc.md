# Getting Funds to BNB Chain

### Connecting to BNB Chain

If you aren't already connected to BNB Chain in your preferred wallet and you don't know how to do that, you'll need to do that first.

There are plenty of great guides already out there on how to set that up. Here are a few we like, depending on which wallet you're using.

#### Metamask

### Funding Your Wallet

Now that you're on BNB Chain, you'll need to fund your wallet. You can do that by purchasing BNB Chain's native token **BNB** on an exchange like [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/eea/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com), or any other exchange that allows withdrawal to BNB Chain. Just be sure it's **BEP-20**, and not **BEP-2**.

If you already have crypto on another network that you'd like to use on BNB Chainto invest in EquiliBrrrrium Money, you can also just bridge those funds over!

### Bridging to BNB Chain

There are plenty of great services out there these days that make it super simple and hassle-free to bridge funds to BNB Chain from another network. We recommend **Celer Bridge** => [cBRIDGE V2](https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer). Here are some great tutorials to follow if you need help!

Now that you've got your wallet connected to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and your funds ready to deploy, you're finally ready to get started with EquiliBRRRRium. In the next section, let's learn how to actually buy BRRRR and other ecosystem tokens, and then explore some of the different strategies you could use depending on your risk tolerance and how you intend to utilize the protocol.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you haven't already at this point, please thoroughly read through the protocol documentation and be absolutely sure you fully understand each element of the EquiliBRRRRium protocol before proceeding. You'll have a much easier time understanding the potential strategies for using the protocol if you do!
