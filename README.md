## Introduction

**Welcome to EquiliBRRRRium!**&#x20;

![WAG2TMI - We All Gonna Try To Make it!](.gitbook/assets/Discord\_Logo.png)

If this is your first visit, please take the time to read through the documentation before you begin using our protocol. We will guide you through the process of how to get started using EquiliBRRRRium to generate high yield passive revenue stabilized by its exposure to BNB. Let’s dive in!

### Origins

EquiliBRRRRium is rooted in the excellent work of the BSC project called Bomb.Money. We loved the concept and decided to operate a rework and to tweak it in order to offer an even better DeFi experience on the Binance Smart Chain network. The protocol’s name is the embodiment of the teamwork that’s been pushed towards finding the best balance between stability and high yield, so your generated revenue can go BRRRR! safely.\

`Please stare at the countdown on our Dapp to be ready!` :eyes: ``&#x20;

**Look at our** [**Roadmap** ](protocol/roadmap.md)**to know more about the launch.**&#x20;

### Purpose

EquiliBRRRRium is an algostablecoin seigniorage protocol. The goal is to provide the means for its underlying BRRRR asset to maintain a value that is algorithmically pegged to the value of BNB at a 10 000:1 ratio.

\
So, what good is that? We will explore this idea further throughout this documentation, but for now without getting too technical, this opens up a world of possibilities for existing, long-time BNB holders, people already familiar with DeFi, as well as new users just coming into the space.\
\
As the EquiliBRRRRium ecosystem grows over time, the potential future applications are quite literally endless. And, as you proceed through this documentation and learn more about how EquiliBRRRRium protocol works, we will explore some of that potential in more detail.

{% hint style="info" %}
BRRRR is the native token of the EquiliBRRRRium protocol. The built-in stability mechanisms within the protocol aim to maintain BRRRR's peg of 10,000 BRRRR = 1 Binance Coin (BNB) in the long run.
{% endhint %}

### What are the EquiliBRRRRium protocol tokens?

BEquiliBRRRRium’s multi-token protocol currently consists of the following 3 tokens, and each plays a critical role in how the protocol works to maintain peg:

**1- EquiliBRRRRium token ($BRRRR)** : Designed for use as a medium of exchange. $BRRRR is algorithmically pegged to Binance Coin (BNB) at a ratio of X BRRRR to 1 BNB

**2- EquiliBRRRRium Shares ($BRRRRSHARE)** : BRRRRSHARE can be staked in the Boardroom to earn a portion of minted BRRRR as rewards to those BRRRRSHARE holders for investing in the health and stability of the protocol.

**3- EquiliBRRRRium Bonds ($BRRRRBOND)** : BRRRRBOND’s main job is to help incentivize and reward users for helping to regain peg during times of supply contraction below peg.

### How does it work?

The EquiliBRRRRium protocol works arounds an ecosystem of unique tokens and mechanisms that create an automatic, self-reinforcing system to help maintain the peg ( 10,000 BRRRR = 1 BNB).\
Each of these tokens and mechanisms will be explained further on. For now, let’s have a look at a brief overview:

\
\- **When BRRRR price is over the peg**, new BRRRR are minted by the protocol to inflate the supply in an attempt to drive the price down towards the peg. These new BRRRR are allocated to BRRRSHARE holders in the Boardroom, as a reward for their investment and trust in the protocol. This in turn increases the demand for and the value of BRRRSHARE.\
\
\- **When BRRRR price is at the peg**, no new BRRRR will be minted, keeping the supply fixed during this time. Since there will be no new supply coming in, the peg will be maintained indefinitely at this point unless there is a shift in demand. More buying pressure during this time will push the price back up above the BRRRR minting threshold. Conversely, more selling pressure will push the price below the peg.\
\
\- **When BRRRR price drops below the peg**, the protocol will begin to mint BRRRBONDs (up to a maximum debt limit). Experienced investors will have the ability to exchange their BRRRR for these BRRRRBONDs, which they can then redeem for BRRRR at a premium above peg in the future. This removes BRRRR from the total supply, applying upward pressure on the price towards the peg. Besides this, investors who believe in the protocol's ability to maintain peg can just buy BRRRR to essentially purchase BNB at a discount to the market. Both of these incentives are intended to create upward pressure on BRRRR's price when under the peg so that the peg can be regained over time.\

There are so many different ways you can utilize the mechanisms of the EquiliBRRRRium protocol to earn yield. Pick a strategy that is right for you, based upon your own knowledge and experience. Even the most simple and basic of strategies can earn great returns, but feel free to experiment with more complex strategies as you learn how the protocol works!

### What exactly is the peg?

BBRRRR is a token that is intended to track the price of Binance Coin (BNB) algorithmically. The ratio for this peg is set at 10 000 BRRRR to 1 BNB. BRRRR actively tracks this peg via an algorithm, but that does not mean it will be valued at 10 000 BRRRR to 1 BNB at all times as it is not collateralized.

As its name states, all of the EquiliBRRRRium’s features are intended to try and maintain the peg as closely as possible, meaning this will be a perpetual fluctuating process. That is in fact thanks to these fluctuations in price that profits will be generated.

One should expect with certainty that there will be times when the price of BRRRR is below the peg, thus creating opportunities for active investors and traders by incentivizing them to buy the dip in order to regain the peg, and be rewarded for that thanks to BRRRRBOND.
