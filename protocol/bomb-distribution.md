# BRRRR Distribution

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of BRRRR is greater than 1.01, new BRRRR will be minted in the Boardroom.&#x20;

The amount of new BRRRR distributed depends on our position above peg and also the current circulating supply of BRRRR.

| Circulating Supply | Max BRRRR Minted |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 500k or less       | 4.5% expansion   |
| Up to 1M           | 4% expansion     |
| Up to 1.5M         | 3.5% expansion   |
| Up to 2M           | 3% expansion     |
| Up to 5M           | 2.5% expansion   |
| Up to 10M          | 2% expansion     |
| Up to 20M          | 1.5% expansion   |
| Up to 50M          | 1.25% expansion  |
| 50M+               | 1% expansion     |
