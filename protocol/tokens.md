The BRRRR token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanisms within the protocol aim to maintain BRRRR's peg of 10,000 BRRRR = 1 Binance Coin (BNB) in the long run.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that BRRRR actively pegs via an algorithm, but that does not mean it will be valued at 10,000 BRRRR to 1 BNB at all times as **it is not collateralized**.

## BRRRRSHARES - BRRRR Shares

Contract: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000&#x20;

BRRRR Shares (BRRRRSHARE) are one of the ways to measure the value of the EquiliBRRRRium Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to consistently maintain BRRRR close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints BRRRR and distributes it proportionally to all BRRRRSHARE holders who have staked their tokens in the Boardroom.

\
**1-** Treasury/DAO Allocation: X BRRRRSHARE vested linearly 12 months\*&#x20;

2- Team Allocation: X BRRRRSHARE vested linearly over 12 months&#x20;

3- Rewards: X BRRRRRSHARE are allocated for incentivizing liquidity providers in two farming pools for 12 months&#x20;

4- Initial mint: 1 BRRRRSHARE minted upon contract creation for the initial pool

{% hint style="success" %}
The EquiliBRRRRium team will use the treasury funds in any way that they feel is best for the long-term success of the protocol.

## **BRRRRBOND - BRRRR Bonds**

![Equilibrium BRRRRBOND token](../.gitbook/assets/brrrrbond.png)

Contract: [0x**0**000000000000000000000000000000](https://bscscan.com/address/0xda1d9c79240003195d0a67f202efcccc3f78b994)

The main purpose of BRRRR Bonds (BRRRRBOND) is to help incentivize fluctuations in the BRRRR supply during epoch contraction periods. When the TWAP (time-weighted average price) of BRRRR falls below 10,000 to 1 BNB, BRRRRBONDs are issued and can be bought with BRRRR at the current price. Exchanging BRRRR for BRRRRBOND burns BRRRR tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helps to get the price back up to peg. These BRRRRBOND can be redeemed for BRRRR when the price is above peg in the future, plus a premium based on how high above peg we currently are. This conversely creates inflation and subsequent sell pressure for BRRRR when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 10,000 BRRRR to 1 BNB ratio.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Unlike early algorithmic protocols, BRRRRBONDs do not have expiration dates.**
